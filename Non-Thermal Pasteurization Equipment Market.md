This growth is driven by the increasing demand for food and beverage products with extended shelf life, as well as the growing preference for maintaining the nutritional content and taste of food without subjecting it to high heat. Non-thermal pasteurization technologies such as High Pressure Processing (HPP), Pulsed Electric Field (PEF), and Ultrasound are gaining significant traction in various industries, particularly in the food and beverage sector, due to their ability to preserve food quality and safety while minimizing the use of preservatives and additives.</p><p>In addition, the rising awareness about the health benefits of minimally processed food products is further propelling the adoption of non-thermal pasteurization techniques. The market is also benefiting from technological advancements in equipment and processes that offer greater efficiency and scalability. With the global shift towards clean label products and sustainable practices, non-thermal pasteurization equipment is expected to play an integral role in transforming the food processing industry. The growing demand for organic and natural foods, coupled with regulatory pressure for safer food products, is expected to continue driving the market growth in the coming years.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Request PDF Sample Copy of Report: (Including Full TOC, List of Tables &amp; Figures, Chart)&nbsp;@&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/81190/&utm_source=github-GC&utm_medium=262" target="_blank">https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/81190/&utm_source=github-GC&utm_medium=262</a></strong></strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class="">Shared Mobility Market&nbsp;Overview and Projection:</h3><p id="" class="">Using a deliberate segmentation technique, the Shared Mobility Market research study provides a comprehensive analysis of multiple market segments, including application, type, and location.
